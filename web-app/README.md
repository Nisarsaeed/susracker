This module is the **Admin Dashboard** for SusRacker. It is a Next.js application that:

- Connects to the Central Server via **Socket.IO client** to receive real-time `new_alert` events and display them to authorized admins.
- Provides **CRUD operations** for the Criminals collection (create, read, update, delete).
- Secures access with **NextAuth** and server-side protection so only admins can view/manage sensitive data.

## Core Capabilities

- Real-time alert feed: listens to the central server (`new_alert`) and shows incoming alerts in a timeline/list.
- Criminals management: add, edit, delete criminal records (including image upload or base64 image handling).
- Secure admin auth: protected routes and API endpoints; session-based authentication using NextAuth (with JWT/cookie fallback as needed).
- Dashboard statistics: connected cameras, alert counts, breakdowns by type.
